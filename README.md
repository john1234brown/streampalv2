# Streampalv2
Free Streaming Search Engine Website called StreamPal which doesnt host any files directly on its site.
With a P2P Video Providing Service Included ontop of the search engine design!
We hope to make a more secure method of p2p streaming using ipfs gateway system along with a custom event source server to allow secure communication channel to browser clients and file providers without the need for ip address communications by using a custom event source server we can have all the communications proxied through it to reduce ip address of browser clients send to file providers and using ipfs and not direct urls we hope to cut down on alot of the frame injection exploits that would have been possible if we had not used the ipfs and require either ipfs CID v1.0 or the ipns CID locations instead of urls so urls are generated from the browser side to cut down on these potential exploits. again had we not done a system like this!
We also have a niffty file Provider tool Application programmed in nodeJS and using the Electron Module for graphical display to allow drag and drop of video files easily into the proper folder structures along with the easy auto upload to ipfs and publish function it has built into the application so it will help cut down on alot of clicks and drags and folder naming as it auto uploads all the Repositorys you create under it to the ipfs in there own individual folders and each with to there own ipns location so you can compartmentalize where files are to reduce space requirements for some public node access to host it! and decreases the response time it takes for the file to be available publicly by using the multi repository setup inside our application also generating a repository is as simple as filling out a text input box and pressing a button then selecting that repository from a dropdown so you will be actively working on that repository.
This File provider tool we are hoping to publicly release within the next month got a month of final testing and debugging any finale bugs before public release -3/23/2023 est time of release will be 4/23/23.

#   Updates
# 3/11/23
- Currently have a working Electron Node JS Application for File providers to be able to provide through smee just finishing on touching it up and making it easier to use with some drag and drop functions before releasing along with some configuration options which is going to require me to redo some of it quite a bit of its coding actually so it will be coming out soon Also Another Project will be working on is the Cache Database Provider incase there node is not receiving smee msgs but they where cached by database provider the database provider will ensure the file providers files will be accessible! basically this just listens in on them keeps a db of there ping.json Structure each provider you have that can provide a file you post a array list of them to the smee ensuring the system stays running! probably gonna have to include file size checks to ensure files wont go over something like 120mbs or something like this!
- if you want to peep the nodeJS application you can at the replit link here https://replit.com/@JohnsFriends/StreamPal-Browser-Tool-In-NodeJS?v=1 havent pushed the electron update to the replit yet but will soon once i finish up the final touches!

# Our Goals
- We wish to decentralize video streaming of movies and tv shows along with making it as mobile friendly as netflix or plutotv or tubi but instead of using a app you can do it straight through the browser
- We hope to be able to cut down loads of ads by sandboxing the embedded video players but sadly some servers detect sandbox so for those servers we recommend using the Brave browser
- We hope you enjoy our site and as always we wish to remain as legal as possible which is why we dont directly host any content which is listed on our website so we don't break any copyright infringment.
