            </li>
            <li>Then Please make sure you get familiar with how we require the video files to be structured in a folder
              for example look at this image below</li>
            <li><img src="exampleassets/rootfolderexample.png"> This is the Root Folder you should have from Downloading

            <li>This is the inside of the Movie Folder</li>
            <li><img src="exampleassets/insidemoviefolder.png"> The name is determined by the movie name and release
              year but removes illegale characters such as Space characters / slashes etc.. but keeps _ characters as
              they are URL valid characters while also removing Uppercase Characters and replacing with lowercase
              characters!</img></li>
            <li>This is the inside of one of those movies listed above!</li>
            <li><img src="exampleassets/insideamoviesubfolder.png"></img></li>

            <li>This is the inside of the tv shows episode1 hd folder below</li>
            <li><img src="exampleassets/insidetvhdfolder.png"></li>
            <li>Last but not least Please read the Read.me inside the template file as it will contain some information
              on how to update the info.json file properly each time you modify the folder and files</li>
            <li>Also unlike onedrive where the files are symbolicly linked ipfs desktop when you add a folder or file to
              it tends to make its own copy so you might want to familiarize yourself with there command line
              application written in Go / Kubo if you dont want duplicates on your hdd as you can make a Symbolic link
              that way with the command line interface!</li>
            <li>Just have to make sure to publish each time you update the files if you use the Command line route if
              not you will have to delete the old folder and reupload the new folder which its recommended to upload the
              new folder and allow 1 day to go by before deleting the old folder to allow access until the publish gets
              updated on the ipfs servers</li>

            <li><a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/publish-ipns/#publishing-ipns-names-with-kubo">Click Me to follow
                the IPFS Documentation Tutorial on how to do it by command line!</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/file-systems/">Click Me To find out how to setup a Mutable File
                System so you wont have to delete the root folder and have to reupload the root folder with Each change
                it is highly recommended to use this style which mimics how onedrive works only difference is you have
                to manually publish to ipns to update the publics version!</a></li>
            <li>Simpler way of creating a Mutable File system is running this command if you installed the Kubo Command
              line interface for ipfs along with the desktop installation!</li>
            <li>Execute this command V</li>
            <li>ipfs files write /root [path to your (movies and tvshows/Template file you downloaded/root folder
              generated by our File Structure Generator Java Application!)root folder (Not the actual root folder for
              those of u on linux or mac talking about the root folder of the tv shows and movies!) on your computer
              which should be called root i understand how this can be confusing!]</li>
            <li>Then open up IPFS Desktop and go to Files!</li>
            <li>you should see the root folder click the three dots next to it on the far right!</li>
            <li>select Publish to IPNS and make sure to use the same key when publishing either it be the default self
              key etc..</li>
            <li>Or follow along these image tutorials to update your public file repo and get your ipns url if you
              havent generated it yet! following the traditional IPFS file scheme!</li>
            <li>First you will need to Add the New Folder using the IPFS Desktop app under Files Click +Import</li>
            <li>you will import the root folder! and then right click the three dots next to the newly imported root
              folder if you are updating! and select publish to IPNS make sure to use the same signing key so you keep
              the same IPNS CID so streaming website can always keep up with your movie and tv show files and allow
              users to stream from them!</li>
            <li>Also please take the time to enjoy the fact that you dont have to constantly re upload everytime video
              gets taken down by copyright flag etc.. since there is no moderation over the ipfs network as its not
              meant to be moderated!</li>
            <li>Please Note you will have to run the IPFS Desktop app atleast 1 time a day every 24 hours to ensure the
              files stay public over ipns if not they will be be made available publicly next time you bring the IPFS
              Desktop app online!</li>
            <li>This is due to how the IPFS Service works requires atleast communication once every 24 hours to
              republish as it uses a 24 hour certificate system to make the ipns available across multiple gateways such
              as dweb.link and ipfs.io etc..</li>
